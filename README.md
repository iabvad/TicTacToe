# TicTacToe

This is a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java. The game allows two players to take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

**Features**

1. **Two Players:** Play against a friend in a turn-based fashion.
2. **Console Interface:** The game runs entirely in the console, making it easy to play anywhere.
3. **Randomized First Player:** The game randomly selects the starting player for each new game.
4. **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of each player's score throughout multiple games.

**How to Play**

The game starts by displaying an empty Tic Tac Toe board.
Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the position they want to place their symbol (1-9).
The game alternates between players until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw.
After each game, the scores are displayed, and players can choose to play again.
